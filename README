This is  the code I have written my self to produce my webpage.
It's no where perfect but it fits the needs of the page I think.
I've tried for a single controller with a non id driven DB which
is why it looks like it does.
This is very much a trial and error project so don't get impressed.
I'm not ashamed of it but I know there are a lot better ways of
doing this.
Server was first on PHP4 with MySQL3, Now it's PHP5 with MySQL4
which might show up here and where in my solutions of how I've
done things.
